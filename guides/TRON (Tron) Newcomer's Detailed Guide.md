## Advanced TRON Mechanics  

### Consensus Mechanism: DPoS & TVM  
TRON employs **Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)**, where 27 Super Representatives validate transactions. The **TRON Virtual Machine (TVM)** powers smart contract execution, offering compatibility with Ethereum's Solidity language for developer accessibility.  

### Energy Management Strategies  
New users often struggle with energy costs. Solutions include:  
1. **Staking TRX** to lease energy proportionally  
2. **Using energy-sharing platforms** like Energy Station  
3. **Optimizing transaction timing** during low network congestion
