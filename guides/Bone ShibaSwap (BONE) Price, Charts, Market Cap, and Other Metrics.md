# Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) Price, Charts, Market Cap, and Other Metrics

## What is Bone ShibaSwap (BONE)?  
Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) is a governance token for the decentralized exchange (DEX) ShibaSwap, designed to empower community-driven decision-making. The Shib Army, a dedicated group of Shiba Inu enthusiasts, uses BONE to vote on protocol upgrades, propose new features, and access future NFT releases. Token holders' voting power scales with their BONE holdings, creating a democratic governance model.  

As an Ethereum-based token, BONE operates within the Shiba Inu ecosystem alongside Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Doge Killer (LEASH). While SHIB positions itself as a "Dogecoin killer," BONE serves as a critical utility token for maintaining ShibaSwap's decentralized infrastructure. Launched on July 7, 2021, ShibaSwap enables users to trade SHIB and other cryptocurrencies while incentivizing liquidity providers with BONE rewards through staking mechanisms.

### Unique Features of Bone ShibaSwap  
BONE distinguishes itself through three core attributes:  
1. **Community Governance**: Token holders shape the platform's development roadmap.  
2. **Liquidity Incentives**: Staking BONE rewards users for providing liquidity to SHIB and other token pairs.  
3. **NFT Access**: Grants exclusive rights to participate in future NFT drops within the Shiba ecosystem.
