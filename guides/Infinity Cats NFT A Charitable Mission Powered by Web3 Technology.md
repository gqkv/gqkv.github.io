# Infinity Cats NFT: A Charitable Mission Powered by Web3 Technology

## Project Background  

Infinity Cats NFT represents a groundbreaking initiative that merges blockchain innovation with animal welfare. Originating from Australia, this charity-driven project leverages Web3 technology to transform virtual engagement into tangible support for animals in need. Each NFT in the collection symbolizes a stray cat, with users contributing to real-world rescue efforts through digital ownership. By collecting and customizing these virtual felines with unique accessories, holders directly fund initiatives that protect animals affected by natural disasters or human negligence.
