# SUI Price Surpasses $1.40: 7 Promising Projects with Potential Airdrops  

The SUI token recently reached an impressive milestone, briefly exceeding $1.43 and achieving a 10.51% surge within 24 hours. This growth aligns with the expanding Sui ecosystem, where total value locked (TVL) has skyrocketed as developers and users increasingly adopt its Move-based Layer1 blockchain architecture. For crypto enthusiasts seeking early opportunities, engaging with emerging Sui protocols offers significant potential - particularly those hinting at future token airdrops.  

This guide explores seven high-potential projects across decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain infrastructure, providing actionable steps for liquidity providers, traders, and ecosystem contributors. We'll also address common questions about participating in these opportunities while emphasizing the importance of due diligence.  

## Why Sui Ecosystem Growth Matters  

Sui's innovative parallel processing architecture enables unprecedented transaction throughput, making it ideal for DeFi applications and high-frequency trading platforms. The blockchain's native Move programming language further enhances security and developer efficiency. As institutional investors like Polychain Capital back key ecosystem projects, early adopters now have unique opportunities to engage with protocols before official token launches.  

### Key Engagement Strategy  

Most projects require minimum SUI holdings (typically 100 SUI) for meaningful participation. This threshold ensures participants have sufficient stake to influence protocol development and qualify for potential rewards.
