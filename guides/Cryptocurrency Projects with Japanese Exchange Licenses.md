## Understanding Japan's Virtual Currency Exchange License

Japan's FSA introduced its licensing system in 2017 following the Mt. Gox collapse, aiming to protect investors and ensure market integrity. Key requirements include:

- Minimum capital reserves of Â¥20 million (â‰ˆ$135,000)
- Comprehensive cybersecurity protocols
- Regular financial audits
- Anti-money laundering (AML) compliance
- Customer asset segregation policies

Licensed exchanges must also maintain local offices and submit quarterly operational reports. This regulatory environment positions Japan as a gold standard in crypto oversight.

## Future Outlook

With Japan planning to introduce Web3-friendly reforms in 2024, including security token offerings (STOs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) frameworks, the licensed exchange ecosystem is poised for renewed growth.
