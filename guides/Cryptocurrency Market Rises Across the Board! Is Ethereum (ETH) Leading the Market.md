# Cryptocurrency Market Rises Across the Board! Is Ethereum (ETH) Leading the Market?

The cryptocurrency market has entered a bullish phase, with Ethereum (ETH) emerging as a key driver of price movements. This technical analysis explores the impact of Ethereum's London Upgrade, its deflationary burn mechanism, and market patterns shaping the current rally. Bitcoin (BTC) also shows promising signals as it approaches historical highs.

## Ethereum's Deflationary Burn Mechanism Explained

The successful implementation of Ethereum's London Upgrade has triggered significant market momentum. This upgrade introduced two critical changes:
1. **Transaction fee restructuring** with base fee compression
2. **Permanent ETH burning** mechanism

### Quantifying ETH Supply Dynamics

Current network data reveals:
- 13608 ETH generated daily through block rewards
- 4500 ETH burned daily on average (post-upgrade)
- Net supply change: -33% effective reduction

This supply contraction creates a deflationary pressure equivalent to a Bitcoin-like halving event. The burn rate effectively reduces ETH's circulating supply by one-third annually, creating fundamental support for price appreciation.

### Market Response to Supply Shock

Top 10 market cap cryptocurrencies reacted differently post-upgrade:

| Uniswap (UNI)  | +31.5%           |

ETH's outperformance validates the market's positive reception of the deflationary upgrade.
