## Understanding DeFiLlama's Core Functionality

DeFiLlama (defillama.com) serves as a comprehensive dashboard for monitoring DeFi metrics, with **total value locked (TVL)** being its flagship indicator. This metric quantifies the liquidity deposited into DeFi protocols, offering insights into sector health and protocol performance. The platform's data sources include:

- **Blockchain explorers** for real-time transaction tracking
- **Smart contract audits** to verify liquidity pools
- **CoinGecko APIs** for price and market cap data

By aggregating these inputs, DeFiLlama provides actionable insights for investors, developers, and researchers seeking to navigate the DeFi landscape.

## How DeFiLlama Operates

The platform's architecture combines automated data scraping with manual verification processes:

1. **Data Collection**  
   DeFiLlama's crawlers extract TVL metrics from thousands of smart contracts across supported chains like Ethereum, Solana, and Binance Smart Chain.

2. **Metric Calculation**  
   Algorithms calculate adjusted TVL by discounting "inflated" liquidity from incentivized pools, providing more accurate valuations.

3. **User Interface**  
   Interactive dashboards visualize trends through customizable charts, rankings, and comparative analytics.

This systematic approach ensures users receive reliable data for fundamental analysis of DeFi projects.
