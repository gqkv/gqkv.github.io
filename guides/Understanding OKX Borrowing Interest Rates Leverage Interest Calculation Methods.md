## How Does OKX Determine Borrowing Interest Rates?  

OKX’s borrowing interest rates are dynamically adjusted based on supply and demand for specific assets. Here’s a breakdown of the core principles:  

1. **Interest Rate Distribution**  
   - **Platform Fee**: 15% of daily interest income is allocated to OKX’s risk reserve fund to cover potential liquidation losses.  
   - **User Payouts**: The remaining 85% is distributed to users proportional to their holdings in the **OKX Savings** (formerly “Yubi Bao”) program.  

2. **Earnings Timeline**  
   - **Day 1**: Assets transferred to Savings are not eligible for interest.  
   - **Day 2**: Earnings calculation begins.  
   - **Day 3**: Interest is credited to the user’s Savings account and starts compounding.

## Leverage Borrowing Interest Calculation Explained  

### 1. **Hourly Interest Rate Updates**  
OKX updates interest rates hourly to reflect real-time market conditions:  
- **Benchmark Rate**: Calculated every hour based on the ratio of borrowed funds to Savings deposits.  
- **Daily Rate**: The average of the 24 most recent hourly rates (e.g., if rates fluctuate between 0.0001 and 0.0003 hourly, the daily rate becomes the average of these values).

### 2. **Rate Tiers for Different Assets**  
Interest rates are categorized into six tiers based on the **Borrowed/Deposited (B/L) ratio**:  

| B/L Ratio Range | Interest Tier |  
|------------------|---------------|  
| <10%             | Tier 1 (Lowest) |  
| 10-25%           | Tier 2        |  
| 25-50%           | Tier 3        |  
| 50-75%           | Tier 4        |  
| 75-90%           | Tier 5        |  
| >90%             | Tier 6 (Highest) |  

*Note: Rates for QTUM and IOST are fixed at 0.0005 daily due to discontinued borrowing.*

## Borrowing Cost Lock-In Period  

When users borrow assets:  
- **24-Hour Rate Lock**: The hourly interest rate is locked for 24 hours.  
- **Example**:  
  - User borrows BTC at 10:32 AM on November 26 with a daily rate of 0.0002.  
  - Hourly rate = 0.0002/24 ≈ 0.0000083.  
  - This rate applies until 10:32 AM on November 27, when it updates to the new benchmark.

## Repayment Rules and Penalties  

### 1. **Interest Payment Frequency**  
- **Mandatory Repayment**: Every 7 days.  
- **Early Repayment**: Users can repay interest early to reset the 7-day cycle.  

### 2. **Automated Liquidation**  
If a user fails to repay interest:  
- OKX may **sell assets, cancel orders, or re-place trades** to cover dues.  
- **Liquidation Fee**: 10% of remaining assets after forced repayment goes to the risk reserve fund.  

### 3. **Partial Repayment**  
- Orders are repaid in chronological order (oldest first).  
- **Interest > Principal**: Interest is prioritized over principal repayment.

## Risk Management and Platform Safeguards  

1. **Risk Reserve Fund**:  
   - 15% of interest income and 10% of liquidation proceeds are allocated to cover unexpected losses.  
   - If reserves are insufficient, up to 50% of daily interest income may be used to cover gaps.  

2. **User Responsibility**:  
   - Maintain sufficient balances in leveraged accounts to avoid forced liquidation.  
   - Proactively manage interest payments to preserve trading strategies.

## Conclusion: Prioritize Risk Management  

Leveraged trading magnifies both gains and losses. For example, a trader with a 90% win rate who over-leverages (“hustling”) faces inevitable liquidation every 10 trades. Success in crypto markets hinges on disciplined risk management:  
- **Set stop-loss orders** to limit exposure.  
- **Avoid over-leveraging** to preserve capital.  
- **Regularly review interest rates** to adjust strategies dynamically.
