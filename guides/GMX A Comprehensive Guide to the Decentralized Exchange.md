## Understanding GMX

### What Is GMX?

GMX is a decentralized exchange launched on Arbitrum in September 2021, with subsequent deployment on Avalanche. Originally known as Gambit Financial, the platform rebranded after merging four native tokens (XVIX, GMT, XLGE, xGMT) into GMX at a rate of $2 per token.

### Key Statistics
- **TVL**: $1.16 billion (Arbitrum: $1.03B, Avalanche: $125.99M)
- **Available on**: Arbitrum and Avalanche blockchains
- **Security**: Contracts audited by ABDK Consulting

### Team Structure
While maintaining anonymity, key contributors include:
- **Krunal Amin** (UniDex founder)
- **Benjamin Simon** (Stealth Crypto co-founder)
- Developer known as "X" on Twitter

Governance is community-driven through a DAO with 69,000 participants, where GMX token holders vote on protocol changes.

## Operational Mechanics

### Liquidity Pool (GLP)

The GLP (Global Liquidity Pool) is central to GMX's functionality:
- **Multi-asset pool**: Supports USDC, BTC, ETH, LINK, FRAX, DAI, USDT
- **Liquidity providers** receive GLP tokens for staking
- **Rewards**: 70% of transaction fees in locked GMX (esGMX)

### Staking Mechanism

Stakers earn:
1. **Multiplier Points (MP)** - APR up to 100%
2. **Locked GMX tokens**
3. **ETH/AVAX rewards** from trading fees

Example: Staking 1,000 GMX for a year yields 1,000 MP, enhancing reward potential.

### Trading Features

- **Low fees**: 0.1% per transaction
- **High leverage**: Up to 50x
- **Execution fees** paid to "keepers" verifying prices across Coinbase, Binance, and Bitfinex
